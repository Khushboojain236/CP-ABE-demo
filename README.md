# CP-ABE-demo
The whole code base is based on: Junwei Wang. *Java Realization for Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption.* https://github.com/junwei-wang/cpabe/, 2012

The files have been restructured and the policy and attributes have to reflect the Know-Your-Customer(KYC) 
No code has been written only attributes and policy has been changed for use case
