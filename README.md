# CP-ABE-demo
The following code is from: Junwei Wang. *Java Realization for Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption.* https://github.com/junwei-wang/cpabe/, 2012
No plagirism has been intended. 



The files have been restructured and the policy and attributes have to reflect the Know-Your-Customer(KYC) use case. 
No code has been written only attributes and policy has been changed for use case.
